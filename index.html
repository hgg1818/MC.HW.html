    <h2>The Great returning of MC.HW</h2>
    <p>
    HW.Lee is disappeared on May 31th. Everyone who knew him thought that he is died already.
    Actually when I arrived at home, He isn't live at home. But not long ago,
    I got a <a href="ww.PNG" target="_blank"><u><strong>text</strong></u></a>
    from him.</p>
    <p>I was so surprised because of the fact that he is alive and he is sipping
    a <strong>Maxim coffee mix</strong> in military. ggulggeok gguulggeok!!
    He suddenly appeared and sipping coffee, who had been missing for
    months and had not even heard from him! He is legend...</p>
    <p>When he disappeared,
    he took a math workbook for the CSAT(in korean 'sooneung'), but the
    whereabouts of the books are unknown. Wherever the books were,
    he probably studied hard. His IQ is now over 200. Scholars say this will
    be similar to the level of his game (Maple Story) character.
