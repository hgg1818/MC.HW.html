<p>His dream is to win a gold medal in the Maple Story
of the Olympics or Asian Games. Everyone says it's impossible, but he won't
give up, and I also believe in his passion. I'm already thrilled to think
about returning to Korea with a gold medal on his neck. He is a really good
Maple player and I have no doubt that he will continue to do so.</p>
