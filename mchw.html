<p>HW.Lee is disappeared on May 5th. Everyone who knew him thought that he is died already.
  Actually when I arrived at home, He isn't live at home. But not long ago,
  I got a text from him.</p>

  I was so surprised because of the fact that he is alive and he is sipping
  a <strong>Maxim coffee mix</strong> in military. ggulgguk gguulgguk!!

  <br>He suddenly appeared and sipping coffee, who had been missing for
  months and had not even heard from him! He is legend... When he disappeared,
  he took a math workbook for the CSAT(in korean 'sooneung'), but the
  whereabouts of the books are unknown. Wherever the books were,
  he probably studied hard. His IQ is now over 200. Scholars say this will
  be similar to the level of his game (Maple Story) character.
